# # Plugin API
#
# Client-side plugins can provide the following hooks to interact with lowfab.
#
# The hooks must exist at load-time. Hooks that are added later during
# run-time will not be called.
#
# See [dummyPlugin](plugins/dummy/dummy.html) for a example implementation
# and further documentation of the plugin API.

# ## Plugin Initialization
# The [pluginLoader](pluginLoader.html) will call each plugin's `init` method
# (if provided) after loading the plugin. It is the first method to be called
# and provides access to the [Bundle](bundle.html).

- init

#  ## 3D scene initialization
#
#  Each plugin that provides a `init3d` method is able to initialize its 3D
#  rendering there and receives a three.js node as argument.
#
#  If the plugin needs its node for later use it has to store it in `init3d`
#  because it won't be handed the node again later.

- init3d

#
# A Plugin can specify that its visualization has a new bounding sphere.
# This can be a new model or a "region of interest". It is expected to
# either return null (for 'no new bounding sphere') or return
# {center: vec3d, radius: float}. The renderer will then focus
# the camera on this region

- newBoundingSphere

# ## UI Initalization
#
# `initUi` provides the plugins the possibility to add elements to the UI.
# Receives a object with DOM elements to insert itself into.

- initUi

# if provided, a UI to configure the specified values will be created. changed
# values are always stored in the state, relative to the currently selected node
- getUiSchema

# called when the user enables (opens) the autogenerated config ui.
# the parameter is the currently selected node, null if no node is selected
- uiEnabled

# called when the user collapses the autogenerated config ui.
# the parameter is the currently selected node, null if no node is selected
- uiDisabled

#  ## State synchronization
#
#  The [state synchronization module](statesync.html) will call each plugin's
#  `onStateUpdate` method (if provided) whenever the current state changes
#  due to user input or calculation results on either server or client side.
#
#  The hook provides the new complete state as an argument and a callback that
#  has to be called when the plugin finished its computations

- onStateUpdate


#  ## 3D scene update and animation
#
#  On each render frame the [renderer](render.html) will call the `on3dUpdate`
#  method of all plugins that provide it.
#
#  The callback has one single argument, a DOMHighResTimeStamp, which indicates
#  the current time for when requestAnimationFrame starts to fire callbacks.
#  (according to
#  https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/window.requestAnimationFrame)

- on3dUpdate


#  ## File import
#
#  When a file is loaded into lowfab, the [fileLoader](fileLoader.html) will
#  try to import it with every plugin that implements `importFile` until one
#  succeeds and returns an [OptimizedModel](../common/OptimizedModel.html).
#  The file's name and its content are provided as arguments.

- importFile
