#  #Plugin API#
#
#  Server-side plugins can provide the following hooks to interact with brickify.
#
#  The hooks must exist at load-time. Hooks that are added later during
#  run-time will not be called.
#
#  See [dummyPlugin](plugins/dummy/dummy.html) for an example implementation
#  and further documentation of the plugin API.

#  ##Plugin Initialization##
#  The [pluginLoader](pluginLoader.html) will call each plugin's `init` method
#  (if provided) after loading the plugin. It is the first method to be called.
- init
