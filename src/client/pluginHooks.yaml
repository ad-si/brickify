#  #Plugin API#
#
#  Client-side plugins can provide the following hooks to interact with lowfab.
#
#  The hooks must exist at load-time. Hooks that are added later during
#  run-time will not be called.
#
#  See [dummyPlugin](plugins/dummy/dummy.html) for a example implementation
#  and further documentation of the plugin API.

#  ##Plugin Initialization##
#  The [pluginLoader](pluginLoader.html) will call each plugin's `init` method
#  (if provided) after loading the plugin. It is the first method to be called
#  and provides access to the [global configuration](globals.html), the
#  [state synchronization module](statesync.html) and the [ui module](ui.html).
- init

#  ##State synchronization##
#
#  The [state synchronization module](statesync.html) will call each plugin's
#  `updateState` method (if provided) whenever the current state changes
#  due to user input or calculation results on either server or client side.
#
#  The hook provides both the delta to the previous state and the new complete
#  state as arguments.
- updateState

#  ##3D scene initialization##
#
#  Each plugin that provides a `init3D` method is able to initialize its 3D
#  rendering there and receives a three.js node as argument.
#
#  If the plugin needs its node for later use it has to store it in `init3D`
#  because it won't be handed the node again later.
- init3D

#  ##3D scene update and animation##
#
#  On each render frame the [renderer](render.html) will call the `update3D`
#  method of all plugins that provide it. There are no arguments passed.
- update3D

#  ##File import##
#
#  When a file is loaded into lowfab, the [fileLoader](fileLoader.html) will
#  try to import it with every plugin that implements importFile until one
#  succeeds.
- importFile
