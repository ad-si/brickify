# Dummy Plugin
###

###
# A demo plugin implementation for client-side
#
# We encourage plugin developers to split their plugins in several modules.
# The main file referenced in the module's `package.json`
# will be loaded by the brickify framework.
#
# This file must return a class which provides **hook-methods** that specify
# the interaction between the brickify framework and the plugin.
# E.g. `dummyPlugin.on3dUpdate()`.
#
# @class DummyPlugin
